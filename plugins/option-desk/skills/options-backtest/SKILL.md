name: options-backtest
description: Test an option structure against real price history with modelled premiums, and run a paper forward test that records positions before their outcome is known and marks them against later chains. Reports win rate, mean return on capital at risk, drawdown, a permutation test, a bootstrap interval and a buy-and-hold benchmark. Use when the user asks whether a strategy has worked historically, to backtest or forward test something, whether an edge is real or chance, how a structure performed, or asks to paper trade, track a position, or mark a trade. Not for order placement and not for recommendations, and a backtest result is not a forecast.

# Backtest and forward test

Two different questions. A backtest asks what a rule would have done. A
forward test asks what a position actually did from the moment it was
written down.

## Execution route

Prefer the `option_backtest` MCP tool for a backtest and the
`option_forward_test` MCP tool for the paper ledger. If the matching tool is
not available, use the `optiondesk` commands below. If neither MCP nor the
CLI is available, say that no fresh result can be produced; do not invent
figures or present an example or remembered result as a new analysis.

## Data boundary

Use fresh provider data only when the tool reports that access is allowed.
A local Yahoo adapter also requires the personal-use acknowledgement. A
hosted tool must use a provider that is approved for public display, derived
outputs, storage, and MCP delivery. Never bypass a provider refusal. When no
approved tool is available, analyse a snapshot that the user supplied and
had the right to share. Otherwise, state that current figures are unavailable.

## Backtest

```
optiondesk backtest SPY iron_condor --holding-days 30 --entry-every 5 --period 5y
```

Enters the structure on a fixed schedule, holds to expiry, settles against
the real close. Reports trades, win rate, mean return on capital at risk,
total in risk units, drawdown, a permutation test, a bootstrap interval
for the mean, and the same schedule holding the underlying instead.

## Forward test

```
optiondesk forward open --strategy iron_condor --thesis "range bound into expiry"
optiondesk forward mark            # after a newer chain snapshot exists
optiondesk forward status
optiondesk forward close --id <id> --price 775
```

## What you must say about a result

Four things, in this order, every time. The full argument for each is in
`reference.md`; these are the versions you cannot skip.

1. Quote the `honesty` field from the artifact before the headline number.
   It is not boilerplate: premiums are modelled and entry and exit use the
   same model, so the test cannot see an edge that comes from the market
   disagreeing with that model.
2. Give the benchmark alongside the result. A structure that is long the
   market shows the market's drift, and without the benchmark that drift
   gets credited to the strategy.
3. Give the p-value with its caveat, not on its own. A strategy chosen
   because its backtest looked good has already spent its degrees of
   freedom.
4. Under thirty trades, decline to draw conclusions.

For a forward test, two more. It is paper, so entry and marks are mid
quotes and a real entry would have crossed the spread on every leg; what it
removes is hindsight, not cost. And a position with a leg missing from the
newer chain comes back unmarkable rather than marked at zero. Report it
that way: a missing wing marked at zero turns a losing short spread into a
full credit win, which is the most flattering error available and appears
exactly when the position is in trouble.

## Reporting rules

These hold for every number this skill produces.

Cite the artifact path when reporting from it. The artifact is the record;
prose is a summary of it, and a number quoted without its source cannot be
checked later.

Read `degraded` before quoting anything. When it is true, say so and give
`degraded_reason` first, in the same breath as the number rather than as a
footnote. Every command carries both fields in the summary it prints, not
only in the artifact.

Do not re-derive numbers yourself. If a figure is not in the artifact, say
it is not there rather than computing a replacement, and never substitute a
default for a value the pipeline refused to produce.

Premiums are model values or mid quotes from delayed third-party data. They
are not fills, and a real entry crosses the spread on every leg.

Never recommend a trade, an entry, an exit or a size. This is research
software and it is not investment advice. Present the analysis and let the
reader decide.
The full terms are in DISCLAIMER.md, which ships beside this skill when it
is installed from a package and sits at the repository root otherwise. The
substance is already above: research software, not advice, modelled numbers
that are not fills.


## What an audit found in these numbers, and what to say about it

Three independent verifications recomputed this project's arithmetic in
2026. The backtest statistics reproduced bit for bit. Two things about how
they are read did not, and both change what a result means.

**The windows overlap.** A thirty day hold entered every five trading days
shares twenty-five of its thirty days with its neighbour. Measured
autocorrelation is positive through lag five and collapses at lag six, and
the effective sample is 64 to 88 rather than 233. The significance test and
the interval now resample blocks rather than single trades, and every
artifact carries `overlap_block`. When it is above one, say so: the
p-value beside it is a block p-value, and the trade count is not the number
of independent observations. Correcting this moved four structures from
below 0.05 to above it, one from 0.0005 to 0.148.

**A structure can enter trades and report no statistics.** When the maximum
loss is unbounded there is no capital at risk to divide by, so every return
on risk is undefined and the statistics object is empty. Read
`trades_entered`, not a trade count of zero. The run worked; the ratio has
no denominator. Saying "no trades" there is wrong and sends a reader
looking for missing price history.

Both are in the artifact. Neither is in the headline figure, so it falls to
you to say them.

## Going deeper

- `reference.md`: the honesty rule in full, how the statistics are computed, and the caveat that outranks all of them.
- `workflows/evaluate-a-rule.md`: the four questions in the order that stops a backtest selling itself.
